# Spinspirational API

This is an example Web API built using Go/Gin, for a fictional Record Store, Spinspirational.

This is my first time writing Go, and am I using [this](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin) tutorial to familiarize myself with Gin and Go.

I am not using a persistence layer with this API, but I plan on building an entirely functional Go WebAPI in a future project.
